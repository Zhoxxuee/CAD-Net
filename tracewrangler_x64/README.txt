General Information
-------------------

TraceWrangler is a toolkit to edit, modify and create network packet capture
files (also known as PCAP, trace, capture, packet log). It also includes
additional command line tools like ngconvert and pcaptouch. ngconvert is capable
of converting capture file formats other than PCAPng to pcapng, while pcaptouch
is used to modify file time stamps.

Installation
------------

TraceWrangler runs on most Windows systems, and is known to run on Linux using
WINE as well. 

The installation of TraceWrangler and the other tools is really simple - copy
the executable anywhere you like, and just start it.


Compiling TraceWrangler 
-----------------------

To compile TraceWrangler and the other tools from source without modifications
the following build system is required:

- Delphi 10.1 Berlin Professional
- FireDAC Client/Server Add-on pack for Delphi
- the VirtualTreeView component (third party, free)
- SmartInspect log system (third party)

Yes, I know, it is expensive for a hobby project. Sorry. I already had it when I
started.
